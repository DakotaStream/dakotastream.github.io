 1) Wiring techniques:
 One technique to help you avoid wiring errors is to make a photocopy of your design. Then, as you
 connect wire after wire, use an accent marker to color in each completed connection. Another thing you
 can do is to place a piece of tape or a small peel-off label indicating the unit number on each chip. Now,

 Use two 7474 dual flip-flop chips to connect a serial-in, parallel-out shift register as shown in Fig. 1. Draw
 the wiring diagram in your lab notebook (refer to the IC specifications document for pin numbers or use
 ExpessSCH). Connect L1â€“L4 to four LEDs (from the LED bar graph), SW1 and SW2 to switches, and
 CLK to a pulser. Implement your design on your breadboard. Test circuit behavior as follows.
-
  (1) Initially, set SW2 to logic 0 to clear all flip-flops (diagram shows SW2 as active-low).
  (2) Now set both SW2 and SW1 to logic 1. Flipflops are no longer being cleared and serial input is high.
  (3) Push the pulser button several times to allow a series of logic 1's to be shifted into the shift register.
  (4) Change SW1 to logic 0 and repeat the experiment.
